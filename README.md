Here's an explanation for the getContractBalance function that we just defined:

    The function is a public function, which means it can be called by other users and smart contracts.
    It is a view function, which means it does not change the state of the blockchain.
    It takes in an address as the input and returns a uint, which is the balance of the contract on that address. The returned balance will be in the uint form that means it will be returned in the units of wei.
    It uses the balance property to return the balance of the contract.
